Playtest 1
Added the teleporter mechanic.
3 teleporters in the game that transport ball to a fixed location.

Issues:
-Ball speed
-Basic feature prototype, not a "game" yet


Playtest 2
A proper prototype

Feedback:
-Lots of downtime/Aimless
-Confusing/disorienting at first
-Portals matching colours so you can find your way
-Delay after teleport so player has time to orient
-Too zoomed in
-Ball escaping map

Implemented changes:
-More paddles for player engagement
-A bit of a tutorial area for player to experience the mechanics before being tossed into the map
-Glass top

Issues:
-Ball speed (losing too much velocity)
-Ball phasing through the top 


Playtest 3
Feedback:
-Fine-tune map and layout
-Instruction/progress text?
-Differentiate end goal portal
-Beach themed map 

Implemented changes:
-Adjusted speed and wall materials
-Fixed phasing through the map
-Checkpoint balls to unlock map progression

My pinball game is a sort of adventure game where the player is bounced around the map by numerous flippers and teleporters.
To win, they must unlock and find the correct portal leading to the end room.
Ultimately, a few suggestions were added to keep the game a challenge and maintain a certain level of difficulty. 
Players have to rely on memory to find the right combination of teleporters and players who have adapting to the game mechanics
would only find slowing down the game to be frustrating once they're used to the gameplay. 
My understanding of unity is not great but I tried to use simple mechanics to create an interesting game.
